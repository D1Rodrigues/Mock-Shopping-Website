       <h2> HOW TO INSTALL THE MATERIALIZE FRAMEWORK </h2> <br>
       Installing this frontend framework on the platform of your choice is quite simple. 
       In order to install Materialize so it can be used for your website or other web development endeavour, 
       simply download the Materialize (for beginners, the standard version with little extra setup required) or 
       the Sass package (which requires a compiler and allows you to choose which components you want, since it includes
       the source SCSS files). These packages can be downloaded from the Materialize website.

       Finally, in the code for your webpage, simply link the Materialize files to use it, as seen below. It is also recommended to import Javascript files in order to read the time it takes to load your webpages.

       Since Django is purely Python, we need to install Python first. The latest version of Python can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">the official Python site.</a>
       Next, in order to get the latest, official release, download and setup pip. To do this, download the get-pip.py file and place it in the Python directory. Next install pip by running the following command:

       Once this is done, simply use this following pip command to install django:
