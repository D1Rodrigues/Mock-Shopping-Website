            <p class = "paragraph"> Materialize is a responsive, open source CSS framework based on Material Design by Google. It is 
                designed to offer slick and stylish designs with ease. It is a UX framework that how different aspects and elements appear
                and behave on a web page. Materialize comes with a CSS and JavaScript framework as well as several different components and icons. 
                Materialize uses a 12 column grid for easy to plan page layout and design. Materialize also has a similar alternative called SASS 
                that is closely related to Materialize and easy to understand. If you are using some sort of android device, there is a possibility 
                that it using materialize. 
            </p>
            <p class = "paragraph"> Design is made simple with Materialize. Since the Materialize framework incorporates CSS and Javascript, several
                effects can be easily acheived. Without Materialize, creating and implementing animations, transistions and effects take several lines of 
                code to accomplish. On top of that, it requires not only proper timing but sometimes intimate understanding of both Java Script and CSS. 
                Materialize simplifies all of that. When creating a slideshow with Javascript, it could total up to 5-15 lines of Javascript code just to create the 
                container the pictures are sitting in whereas Materialize only requires one "div" class to create. Materialize also include several built-in icons 
                and forms that are compatible with all modern browsers. Since Materialize is a framework that incorporates CSS 
                and Javascript, it drastically cuts down the time needed to create and design a web page.
            </p>

            <img src ="Stylesheets/Pictures/Before.png" id="imgBefore"> 
                <figcaption class = 'caption'> Current Web Page Without Materialize</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p class = "paragraph"> However, despite its ease of use and versatile design, Materialize is far from perfect.
                Being a relatively new framework, Materialize is not compatible with some older browsers such as Safari 8 and 
                almost all Internet Explorer browsers besides edge. This can be a problem for users who are dedicated to using an older browser. 
                If you are one of those people, I recommend that you abstain from using this Framwork. Materialize, like any framework, restricts some 
                control over the design and layout of a page. While Materialize is versatile and will save developers time on creating and designing a web page, 
                its versatility pales in comparison to some other frameworks or even pure CSS/Javascript. This is not to say that the built-in components are 
                don't give you choices but if you want better control over every little detail of your web page, I suggest using a different framework 
                or using Pure CSS/Javascript.

            <p class = "paragraph"> Django is high-level Python based framework intially released in 2005. It is a primarily a 
                back-end framework that focuses on security and maintainability. Like any framework, it comes with several functions 
                and packages that can be used without prior coding required. Some of the functionalities include: Built-in User authenication, Admin interfacing 
                , Database migration, URL routing, etc. Since Django is a python based framework, the readability of code and 
                syntax python is known for, benefits developers attempting to learn Django. Along with python's versatility, this allows
                Django to be diverse and flexible while also being secure and easy to read. 
            </p>
            <p class = "paragraph"> However there are some downside when using Django. Unlike other frameworks, everything in Django has to be explicitly defined. 
                This means before any functions can be implement, every little thing must be defined. This leads to web pages taking longer to develop as well as 
                confusion for developers who are not used to defining everything as opposed to other frameworks. Django design also does not allow for developers to 
                change file heirarchy and order. Also readability does not equal difficulty.Though Django is based in python and easy to read once a developer understands 
                Django, the intial learning curve can be steep for some people. The way that Django is structured causes difficulty for many developers learning the language. 
                Though once a devloper gets through the intial curve, it is relatively easier to understand and read the code from there.
