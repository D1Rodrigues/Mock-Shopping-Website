    <p class ="Whatis">  OUR THOUGHTS ON THE CHOSEN FRAMEWORK </p>

    <p class = "sub_Main"> Performance</p>
    <p class = "paragraph">
        We did not have many expectations for Materialize however it more than met them. It was extremely simple to use, it had a lot of 
        documentation and its various features made designing the visual aspects of the demo page much easier. For Django, again our expectations were not
        very high but it did everything we needed it to and much more. It worked well with the Python commands we used in the backend and 
        made programming much easier.
    </p> 
   

    <p class = "sub_Main">EXPERIENCE WITH THE INSTALLATION PROCESS</p>
    <p class = "paragraph">
        Materialize was extremely easy to install and configure. The instructions were easy to follow and trivial. We simply needed to install
        the necessary files on our computers and then link to in our source code. Meanwhile, with Django, we found it slightly harder because
        it required the terminal to install, configure and initalize in our project directory. 
    </p>

    <p class = "sub_Main"> EASE OF USE </p>
    <p class = "paragraph">
        Creating our webpages was easy when it came to using Materialize. It was easy to figure out how to use the various features and syntax of that
        frontend framework in deciding the look of the pages; it also saved time and effort that would have been otherwise spent on plain HTML/CSS code.
        Materialize acted as intermediary between us and the HTML/CSS, which made the overal process easier. Next, Django already had many
        templates available for frontend work, which made constructing for the demo page more streamlined.
    </p>

    <p class = "sub_Main"> LEARNING CURVE</p>
    <p class = "paragraph">
        Materialize took little time and effort for the reasons mentioned previously, such as helpful documentation, easily understandable syntax and features,
        relatively limited verbosity as well as its similar to typical HTML/CSS code. Django on the other had a much steeper leaning curve and took much more time
        to learn. For those who do not have much experience with backend work, Django's functionality will not be very intuitive. While Django differs from Python 
        in many aspects, its Python foundation does make its utility much easier, even if everything in Django needs to be declared before it can be used.
    </p>

    <p class = "sub_Main"> RETROSPECT </p>
    <p class = "paragraph">
        On the whole, while we were tempted to use a different framework other than Django because of its steeping curve and 
        its unconventional aspects. However, in the end,  we never regretted using Django because that framework helped actualize
        all our conceptions for our website's design. Moreover, Materialize made front end work very easy so it is very hard to imagine 
        doing any frontend work without it.
