       <p class = "sub_Main"> A Quick and Simple Guide </p>
       <hr class = "line"> 
       <p class = "paragraph"> Installing the materialize framework on the platform of your choice is quick and simple. 
       In order to install Materialize for development, first go to the materialize website <a href = "https://materializecss.com/"> here</a>.
       From there, click on the "Getting Started" tab and you will be directed to two different packages called Materialize and SASS. 
       For beginners, we suggest downloading the standard version since it does not require much setup and includes all components that Materialize
       has to offer. However, if you want control over which components you want to include, then we suggest downloading SASS. 
       Though you need a complier, the SASS package allows developers control over which components they want from Materialize, saving storage space and effort.</p>

       <p class="paragraph"> Next, simply extract the contents of the downloaded package into the directory of your website, as shown below. </p>

        <p class="paragraph">Finally, in the code for your webpage, simply link the Materialize files to use it, as seen below. It is also recommended to import 
            Javascript files in order to read the time it takes to load your webpages. </p>

       <p class="paragraph">Since Django is purely Python, we need to install Python first. The latest version of Python can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">the official Python site.</a>
       Next, in order to get the latest, official release, download and setup pip. To do this, download the get-pip.py file and place it in the Python directory. Next install pip by running the following command:</p>
